The ETH-80 dataset is needed to be downloaded(https://github.com/Kai-Xuan/ETH-80/),  
and put 8 filefolders(visual image sets from 8 different categories) into filefolder '.\ETH-80\'.  
Please run 'read_ETH.m' to generate Kernel Matrix Representation. Then run 'run_ETH.m' for image set classification.  


For more experiment, you can test on Virus dataset (https://github.com/Kai-Xuan/Virus/)
